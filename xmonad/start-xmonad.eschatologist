# KLUDGES AND WORKAROUNDS
#

# Clear xmonad.state before starting xmonad -- otherwise this causes weird
# issues, especially when going between single screen and multi-screen
rm -f ~/.xmonad/xmonad.state

#
# GENERAL INITIALIZATION
#

# Identify the home of our gtkrc file, important for setting styles of
# gtk-based applications
export GTK2_RC_FILES="$HOME/.gtkrc-2.0"

# Load X resources (fixes some font issues)
xrdb -merge .Xresources

# Start compositing to support transparency. You can omit this
# if you prefer not to use any transparency, but it is likely to cause
# ugly black fringing with some programs such as synapse that expect
# transparency support.
xcompmgr -n &

#
# SCREEN CONFIGURATION
#

# Default icon slot size for tray icons...
# We will adjust this parameter if necessary depending on the
# screen we end up using, to avoid gaps between xmobar and stalonetray
STALONETRAY_SLOT_SIZE=28

# We handle our screen configuration using xrandr. You are likely to want to
# edit this section to match the specific demands of your setup. The below
# setup is for a Lenovo W520 laptop that sometimes has an external monitor
# hooked up via either VGA or DVI, positioned to the left of the laptop.
#
# Note that you can run xrandr at the command line to get a list of your
# connected screens and find out what names you should use to refer to them.

# Activate primary screen
#xrandr --output DP-2 --auto --primary

# TODO add xrandr for second monitor...

#
# LOAD SCREEN BACKGROUNDS
#

# To set your backgrounds, run nitrogren /path/to/images
nitrogen --restore &

#
# STARTUP ICON TRAY
#

# We are using stalonetray to create a small icon tray at the
# top right of the screen. You are likely to want to tweak the
# size of the icons and the width of the tray based upon the
# size of your screen and your xmobar configuration. The goal is
# to make stalonetray look like it is part of xmobar.
#
# Line by line, the options used by default below mean:
# - icons should be aligned with the "East" or right side of the tray
# - the width of the tray should be 5 icons wide by one icon tall, and it
#   should be located 0 pixels from the right of the screen (-0) and 0 pixels
#   from the top of the screen (+0).
# - By setting our maximum geometry to the same thing, the tray will not grow.
# - The background color of the tray should be black.
# - This program should not show up in any taskbar.
# - Icons should be set to size "24".
# - Kludges argument of "force_icons_size" forces all icons to really, truly
#   be the size we set.
# - window-strut "none" means windows are allowed to cover the tray. In
#   other words, trust xmonad to handle this part.
