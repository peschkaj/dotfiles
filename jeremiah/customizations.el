;;; It's a place to put customizations above and beyond what Emacs
;;; ships with. The ideas in here were taken from a conversation with
;;; Raju Gandhi, but he claims the come from starter-mode. Hell if I
;;; know, really.
;;;
;;; so I put the git repo of org-mode in there
;;; and I have a file in there called customization.el
;;; with this line
;;; (setq load-path (cons "~/.emacs.d/looselytyped/org-mode/lisp" load-path))
;;; Done
;;; Now your latest version will override the one that ships with
;;; emacs.
